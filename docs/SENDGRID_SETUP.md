# SendGrid Integration Setup

## Configuration Steps

1. **Get SendGrid API Key**
   - Sign up for a SendGrid account at https://sendgrid.com
   - Navigate to Settings > API Keys
   - Create a new API key with "Mail Send" permissions
   - Copy the API key

2. **Verify Sender Email**
   - Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
   - Verify your "from" email address (the email you'll send from)
   - This is required by SendGrid to prevent spam

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   Update your `.env` file with your actual values:
   ```bash
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_actual_sendgrid_api_key_here
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_sender_email@domain.com
   SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL=your_email_where_you_want_to_receive_contact_forms@domain.com
   ```

## Email Features

### ðŸ“§ **Dual Email System**
When a user submits the contact form, two emails are sent simultaneously:

1. **Business Notification Email** (to you):
   - Professional format with all contact details
   - Color-coded priority levels
   - Easy reply functionality
   - Comprehensive project information

2. **User Confirmation Email** (to the customer):
   - Marketing-focused messaging aligned with your brand
   - Dark theme matching your app design
   - Clear timeline and next steps
   - Professional yet personal tone
   - Call-to-action to view portfolio

### ðŸŽ¯ **Marketing-Focused User Email**
- **Engaging subject**: "Thanks for reaching out! Your project inquiry is received ðŸš€"
- **Personal greeting** with their name
- **Clear timeline** of what happens next (24-48 hour response)
- **Value proposition** highlighting your unique approach
- **Social proof** mentions of portfolio and success stories
- **Professional branding** with consistent color scheme

## Important Notes

- **SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL**: Must be a verified email address in your SendGrid account
- **SENDGRID_TO_EMAIL**: Your email where you want to receive contact form submissions
- The contact form submitter's email will be set as the reply-to address
- Email templates include both HTML and text versions
- Priority levels are color-coded in the HTML email
- Both emails are sent using Promise.allSettled for reliability

## Testing

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to your contact form
3. Submit a test message
4. Check both:
   - Your business email for the detailed notification
   - The test email address for the confirmation message

## Troubleshooting

- If emails aren't sending, check the server logs for SendGrid error messages
- Ensure your API key has the correct permissions
- Verify that your sender email is authenticated with SendGrid
- Check that environment variables are properly loaded
- Both emails are logged separately in the console for debugging
